Disclaimer: The starter ipynb file would not load so the entire module challenge was done using the google co lab file.

The goal of this challenge was to use the home_sales_revised.csv file from the AWS S3 bucket location and a PySpark DataFrame in order to generate information such as average price for houses under several different circumstances, such as bedroom count, bathroom count, square footage.
